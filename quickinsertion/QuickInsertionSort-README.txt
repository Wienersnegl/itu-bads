** Assignment info:
   Mark one of the following boxes with an X
   [X] Yes, to the best of our knowledge, everything works as it
   should. In particular, here is the test client that our code has
   passed:


   	// test client
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		int ntest = 100; // no. tests/cutoff value
		int cmin = 0; // cutoff min value
		int cmax = 20; // cutoff max value
		double[] runtime = new double[ntest];
		
		// for each size of array
		for (int n = 100; n <= 1000000; n *= 10) {
			StdOut.println("Testing for n="+n);
			// for each cutoff value 0..cmax
			for(int m = cmin; m < cmax+1; m++) {
				double total = 0.0;
				double dev = 0.0;
				double avg = 0.0;
				double stdDeviate = 0.0;
				// do ntest tests
				for(int t = 0; t < ntest; t++) {
					int[] a = randomIntList2(n, 10*n);
					// time and sort
					long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
					sort(a, m);
					runtime[t] = (System.currentTimeMillis() - start) / 1000.0;
				}
				// average runtime for all tests
				for (int k = 0; k < runtime.length; k++) {
					avg += runtime[k];
				}
				avg /= ntest;
				// std deviation
				for (int l = 0; l < runtime.length; l++) {
					dev += Math.pow(runtime[l]-avg, 2);
				}
				stdDeviate = Math.sqrt(dev/100);
				StdOut.println("m="+m+" avg="+avg+" std dev="+stdDeviate);
			}
			StdOut.println("n="+n+" done\n\n");
		}

   [ ] No, our solution does not work. (We will not get credit for this.)
   In particular, it sorts 

   .... (some numbers)

   to 

   .... (some numbers, not correctly sorted)


   - Total hours to complete the assignment (optional): ...


   RESULTS
   
   For each N, either complete the 7 lines (where it says ...) or
   remove the lines are write "Couldn't see a difference".

   N = 100:
   No cutoff:
   mean running time: 5.0E-5 s
   standard deviation: 2.18E-4
   
   With cutoff = 12
   mean running time: 1.0E-5 s 
   standard deviation: 9.95E-5
