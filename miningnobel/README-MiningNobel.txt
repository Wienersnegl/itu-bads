Please mark one of the following boxes with an X

[ ] Yes, to the best of our knowledge, our N^3 log N solution works as
it should.

[ ] No, our solution does not work. (We will not get credit for this.)
Here's what doesn't work:



/**********************************************************************
 * Consider your exhaustive search implementation.
 *
 * Let N denote the number of input values.
 *
 * Estimate the number of comparisons by looking at the code. 
 * Use tilde notation.
 * (Don't forget  the comparisons in the condition of your for loops!)
 * 
 * Perform experimental running time analysis using the Stopwatch
 * class from Sedgewick and Wayne, Algorithms 4th edition.
 *
 * Estimate the largest N you can process based on your theoretical
 * and practical analyses.

[ ] Yes, our experiments are consistent with our theoretical analysis

/**********************************************************************
 * More numbers!
 *
 * This part is completely optional. Please help making this exercise
 * better by providing even more important-looking constants.
 * Remember that we need the natural logarithm, rounded to the nearest
 * power of 2^(-20). Do it like this:
 *
 *   private static final double rounding = 9.5367431640625E-7;
 *
 *   private static  double round(double value) {
 *	  return ((int) (value / rounding)) * rounding;
 *      }
 *   ...
 *   double ln_value = round(Math.log( the_original_value ))); 
 *   ...
 *
 * Use the format below, with the original value in parentheses.
 *
 * If I find your suggestions sufficiently entertaining I'll
 * put them in the next version of  this exercise.
 * If you want to be credited, please tell me by which name
 * here: .......
